In DEBUG mode, the Topmost property set to False on the MainForm to avoid the form covers everything.
In RELEASE mode this property set to True as expected.

If you want to install the screen saver, build it in Release mode, go to the bin\Release folder,
right click on the VideoScreenSaver.scr file and select "Install" from the context menu.
